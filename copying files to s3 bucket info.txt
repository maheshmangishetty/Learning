
To copy a file from your local to S3 bucket using the AWS CLI, you can use the following command:

aws s3 cp local-file-path s3://bucket-name/remote-file-path



For example, to copy the file my-file.txt from your local directory to the S3 bucket my-bucket, you would use the following command:

aws s3 cp my-file.txt s3://my-bucket/my-file.txt



You can also use the AWS CLI to copy multiple files from your local machine to an S3 bucket. To do this, you can use the following command:

aws s3 cp local-directory-path s3://bucket-name/remote-directory-path --recursive



For example, to copy all of the files in the directory my-directory to the S3 bucket my-bucket, you would use the following command:

aws s3 cp my-directory s3://my-bucket/my-directory --recursive



You can also use the AWS CLI to copy a file from one S3 bucket to another. To do this, you can use the following command:

aws s3 cp s3://source-bucket/source-file-path s3://destination-bucket/destination-file-path


For example, to copy the file my-file.txt from the S3 bucket my-source-bucket to the S3 bucket my-destination-bucket, you would use the following command:

aws s3 cp s3://my-source-bucket/my-file.txt s3://my-destination-bucket/my-file.txt
