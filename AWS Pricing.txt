Introduction
-------------

--> AWS offers many services with a unique billing model.
--> AWS is truly on-demand and offers a pay-per-use solution.
--> Overwhelming amount of customization options for each service.
--> Each service requires in-depth knowledge.
--> AWS has data centers across the globe adding more complexity.



Pricing foundation
-------------------

--> Itâ€™s important to understand account billing prior to registration.
--> A compromised account can be a very costly issue.
--> Without proper controls you can incur unexpected usage charges.
--> AWS offers customers a high level of freedom and control over their
account.
--> This flexibility can come with consequences.
--> Make sure to understand AWS best practices and billing
methodology behind each service you use.



--> AWS works on a pay-per-use pricing model. You pay for the resources you use on each billing cycle, which is typically monthly.

--> To keep it simple, resources refer to things like storage, computational power (CPU), Ram, and outbound data transfer(bandwidth).

--> You pay less by using more. AWS offers volume based discounts as your usage of resources increases for specific services. For examples
AWS S3 storage and data transfer Out from an EC2 virtual server offers a tiered pricing model. The illustration below shows the
change in price per GB of data stored on $3, as the usage increases.

S3

upto 50 TB / Month	$0.023 per GB
Next 51 - 100 TB / Month $0.022 per GB
Over 500 TB / Month	$0.021 per GB

--> You save when you reserve. You can save up to 75% on cost when you commit to using a consistent amount of resources from AWS. This form of pricing 
entails a longer commitment, which can be structured in three different ways:

> All up-front (AURI)
> partial up-front (PURI)
> no upfront payments (NURI)


When you buy reserve instances the larger the upfront payment the greater the discount. To maximize the savings, you can pay all up-front and 
receive the largest discount.
partial up-fronts gets lower discount 
no up-front receives smaller discount.


Resources can be reserved for 1 0r 3 year terms.


Example:

1 Year no up-front

EC2m4.large

$955/year -  on demand
$650/year - NURI        

32 % savings



1 Year partial up-front

EC2m4.large

$955/year - on demand
$554/year - PURI

42 % savings


1 Year all up-front

EC2m4.large

$955/year - on demand
$545/year - AURI

43 % savings



Free Tier Overview
------------------

AWS Free-Tier is perfect for:

--> Those interested in learning how to use AWS without having to incur expense.
--> Developers looking to test small applications on a scalable cloud platform.
--> Anyone new to AWS looking to take advantage of a great service while saving on usage fees for the first year.


AWS Free-Tier caution:

--> It's important to stay within the usage limits to avoid charges.
--> We will setup billing alerts to notify us if our account exceeds a specified threshold.



750 hours on an EC2 t2.micro or t3.micro instance
--> We can see the specification of each EC2 instance type at the link below:
https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/    

--> We can see here that t2.micro instances include 1vCPU, 2GB of memory(RAM).

750 Hours usage of a db.t2.micro database. This includes:
--> 20GB of General Purpose (SSD) Database Storage
--> 20GB of storage for database backups and DB snapshots.

5GB of Standard Storage ($3)
5GB of Amazon Elastic File Storage (EFS)
30GB of Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS)

Data Transfer-in is always free, so you can migrate as much data to AWS

--> AWS operates clusters of data centers in different physical locations around the world, these are known as regions.

--> AWS offers an interactive map which shows each of its regions and availability zones across the world.

This resource can be found by visiting this link
https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/



Availability Zone:

--> Each logical grouping of data centers within a localized region is called an Availability Zone.

--> Each AZ has independent power, cooling, and physical security and is connected via redundant, ultra-low-latency networks.

--> This segregation of AZ's within each geographic region helps ensure that disruptions in one data center do not affect the other.



AWS Local Zones:

--> Allows infrastructure deployment from geographic locations that are in closest proximity to end users, which offers single-digit millisecond
latency to maximize application deliverability and efficiency.

--> You can deploy AWS compute, storage, database, and other select services in close proximity to large populations, industry, and IT centers.

--> AWS Local zones are generally available in Los Angeles, with plans to extend the offering to Boston, Houston, and Miami.
