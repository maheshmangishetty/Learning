Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform used for automating the deployment, scaling, and management 
of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), 
a part of the Linux Foundation. Kubernetes provides a powerful and flexible framework for container management and is widely adopted in the world of 
cloud-native and containerized applications.

Here are some key concepts and features of Kubernetes:

Container Orchestration: 
------------------------
Kubernetes simplifies the management of containerized applications by automating tasks such as deployment, scaling, load balancing, and rolling updates.

Containers: 
-----------
Kubernetes primarily works with containerized applications. Containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments that package an application 
and its dependencies, making it easy to deploy and run consistently across different environments.

Nodes: 
------
Kubernetes clusters consist of nodes, which are physical or virtual machines that run container workloads. Each node can host one or more containers.

Pods: 
-----
The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes is a Pod, which can contain one or more containers. Containers within the same Pod share the same network 
namespace and storage volume, making it easier for them to communicate and share data.

Services: 
---------
Kubernetes provides networking capabilities to expose applications running in Pods to the external world or to other services within the cluster. 
Services can be used for load balancing and service discovery.

ReplicaSets: 
------------
A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of Pod replicas are running at all times. It helps with scaling applications up or down based on demand.

Deployments: 
------------
Deployments are higher-level abstractions that manage the desired state of an application. They can perform rolling updates and rollbacks, making 
application updates safer and more controlled.

ConfigMaps and Secrets: 
-----------------------
Kubernetes provides mechanisms for managing configuration data (ConfigMaps) and sensitive information (Secrets) separately from application code, 
improving security and flexibility.

Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs): 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Kubernetes allows for the management of persistent storage, enabling applications to store and retrieve data even if containers are rescheduled to different nodes.

Namespace: 
----------
Namespaces provide a way to logically partition a Kubernetes cluster, allowing multiple teams or applications to share the same cluster while maintaining 
isolation and resource quotas.

Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs): 
-----------------------------------
Kubernetes can be extended with custom resources using CRDs. This allows users to define and manage their own resources beyond the built-in ones.



Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration in the cloud-native ecosystem. It abstracts away much of the complexity associated
with managing containerized applications, making it easier to build, deploy, and scale applications in a consistent and reliable manner across various 
infrastructure environments, including on-premises data centers and public cloud platforms.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

container orchestration
-----------------------

Container orchestration refers to the automated management of containerized applications, specifically the coordination of various tasks and resources 
required to deploy, scale, monitor, and maintain container instances. Containers are a lightweight and portable way to package applications and their dependencies, 
and container orchestration platforms help streamline the deployment and management of these containers in a distributed computing environment.

Here are some key aspects of container orchestration:

Deployment: 
-----------
Orchestration platforms automate the deployment of containerized applications, ensuring that containers are started on appropriate host machines within a cluster.

Scaling: 
--------
Container orchestration enables automatic scaling of applications by adding or removing container instances based on factors like resource utilization or 
traffic load. This helps in maintaining optimal application performance and resource utilization.

Load Balancing: 
---------------
Orchestration platforms typically include load balancing mechanisms to distribute incoming traffic across multiple containers running the same application, 
ensuring high availability and even distribution of requests.

Self-Healing: 
-------------
Orchestration platforms monitor container health and can automatically replace or reschedule containers that fail or become unresponsive, improving application 
reliability.

Rolling Updates and Rollbacks: 
------------------------------
Container orchestration allows for seamless rolling updates of applications. It can gradually replace old container instances with new ones, reducing downtime. 
In case of issues, it supports easy rollbacks to a previous version.

Resource Management: 
--------------------
Orchestration platforms manage resource allocation for containers, ensuring that each container gets its fair share of CPU, memory, and other resources, 
preventing resource contention.

Service Discovery: 
------------------
Containerized applications often need to discover and communicate with other services within the cluster. Orchestration platforms provide service discovery 
mechanisms to facilitate this.

Secrets and Configuration Management: 
-------------------------------------
Handling sensitive information like API keys and managing application configurations are essential aspects of orchestration. Platforms typically offer 
solutions for secrets and configuration management.

Storage Management: 
-------------------
Orchestration platforms can manage storage volumes for containers, including the ability to provision, attach, and detach persistent volumes as needed 
by applications.

Networking: 
-----------
Container orchestration platforms handle networking between containers and external services, ensuring that containers can communicate with each other 
and the outside world.

Security: 
---------
Security is a critical concern in containerized environments. Orchestration platforms often include security features such as role-based access control (RBAC), 
network policies, and container image scanning to enhance security.

Popular container orchestration platforms include Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Apache Mesos. Kubernetes has emerged as the leading and most widely adopted 
container orchestration solution, offering a robust set of features and a large ecosystem of tools and extensions.

Container orchestration simplifies the management of containerized applications, making it easier to deploy and scale applications, improve reliability, 
and streamline operations in complex, distributed environments, such as cloud computing and microservices architectures.

Kubernetes Architecture
-----------------------

Kubernetes has a multi-layered architecture designed to provide a scalable and flexible container orchestration platform. Understanding its architecture is 
essential for effectively deploying and managing containerized applications. The key components of the Kubernetes architecture are:

1. Master Node:
---------------

API Server: 
-----------
The Kubernetes API server is the entry point for all administrative tasks and user interactions with the cluster. It exposes the Kubernetes API and acts 
as the control plane component for managing the cluster.

etcd: 
-----
etcd is a distributed key-value store that serves as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data, including configuration settings, metadata, and cluster state. 
It provides consistency and high availability for critical data.

Controller Manager: 
-------------------
The controller manager component manages various controllers that regulate the state of the system. Controllers ensure that the desired state of resources 
(e.g., Pods, Services) matches the current state.


Scheduler: 
----------
The scheduler component is responsible for assigning work (Pods) to worker nodes based on resource requirements, constraints, and policies. It takes into 
account factors like node capacity and affinity/anti-affinity rules.

Cloud Controller Manager (optional): 
------------------------------------
If Kubernetes is running on a cloud platform, this component interacts with the cloud provider's APIs to manage resources like load balancers, storage volumes, 
and virtual machines.


2. Node (Worker Node):
----------------------

Kubelet: 
--------
The Kubelet is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It is responsible for maintaining the state of nodes, ensuring that containers are running in Pods, 
and reporting node status to the control plane.

Container Runtime: 
------------------
Kubernetes supports various container runtimes, such as Docker, containerd, and CRI-O, which actually run the containers within Pods.

Kube Proxy: 
-----------
Kube Proxy is responsible for network routing on the worker nodes. It maintains network rules and enables communication to and from Pods.

Pods: 
-----
Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. They can contain one or more containers that share the same network namespace and storage volumes. 
Containers within the same Pod can communicate with each other using localhost.


3.Add-Ons (Optional):
---------------------

DNS: 
----
Kubernetes can deploy a DNS add-on to provide DNS-based service discovery within the cluster. This allows services to be accessed by their DNS names.

Dashboard: 
----------
Kubernetes Dashboard is a web-based graphical user interface for managing and monitoring the cluster.

Ingress Controllers: 
--------------------
Ingress controllers provide external access to services within the cluster. They manage external traffic routing and load balancing.

Monitoring and Logging: 
-----------------------
Kubernetes can be integrated with various monitoring and logging solutions like Prometheus, Grafana, and Elasticsearch to collect and analyze cluster metrics 
and application logs.

Networking Plugins: 
-------------------
Kubernetes supports various networking plugins, such as Calico, Flannel, and Cilium, which enable network communication between Pods and external networks.

The architecture of a Kubernetes cluster allows for scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance. It separates the control plane components (master node) 
from the worker nodes, making it possible to add or remove worker nodes to accommodate changes in workload and ensuring that the control plane remains highly 
available.

Overall, Kubernetes' modular and extensible architecture provides a solid foundation for deploying and managing containerized applications in a dynamic and 
efficient manner.

What is Kubernetes?
-------------------
• Kubernetes, also known as "K8s", is an open-source
container orchestration platform developed by
Google.

• It is designed to automate the deployment, scaling,
and management of containerized applications across
a cluster of nodes.

• Kubernetes provides a consistent and reliable way to
manage applications, regardless of whether they are
running on-premises, in the cloud, or in hybrid
environments.

pods?
-----
A pod is the smallest execution unit in Kubernetes. A pod encapsulates one or more applications. 
Pods are ephemeral by nature, 
if a pod (or the node it executes on) fails, 
Kubernetes can automatically create a new replica of that pod to continue operations.
allowing our customers to conveniently store and access their belongings right in their driveway.

-kubectl run nginx --image=nginx(create a pod with name nginx)
-kubectl get pods (shows number of pods created)
-kubectl describe pod podname(detail description of pods)
-kubectl get nodes(provides details of how many nodes are there)
-kubectl get pods -o wide(gives additional information)
-kubectl delete pod podname(delete pod)
-kubectl run redis --image=redis123 --dry-run-client -o yaml(redis is name of pod ; redis123 is image name)
-kubectl create -f redis.yaml(to create redis.yaml file)

Yaml:
-----
YAML is a human-friendly language. In the context of Kubernetes, YAML files are mainly used for the 
configuration of K8 pods, services, and deployments. In Kubernetes, YAML is a manifest file,
which performs the functions mentioned above.They dictate how a pod should run,interact with other objects,and more.

Yaml format:
------------
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creation Timestamp: null
  Labels:
    run: redis
  name: redis
spec:
  containers:
  - image: redis123
    name: redis
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
