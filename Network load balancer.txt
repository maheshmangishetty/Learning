
A Network Load Balancer (NLB) is a load balancing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that operates at the network layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model. 
It is designed to handle high traffic volumes and deliver extremely low-latency performance.

The Network Load Balancer is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies. It is particularly suitable for use cases
that require high-throughput and low-latency traffic distribution, such as TCP and UDP-based applications.

Here are some key features and characteristics of the Network Load Balancer:

Layer 4 Load Balancing: 
-----------------------
NLB operates at the transport layer, distributing traffic based on IP protocol data. It can load balance both TCP and UDP traffic.

High Performance: 
-----------------
The Network Load Balancer is designed to handle high volumes of traffic with low latencies. It uses a combination of flow-based and connection-based balancing 
algorithms to efficiently distribute traffic across registered targets.

Elasticity and Scalability: 
---------------------------
NLB automatically scales to handle varying traffic loads. You can add or remove targets from the load balancer without interrupting the existing connections.

Availability and Fault Tolerance: 
---------------------------------
NLB automatically routes traffic only to healthy targets, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. It performs health checks on the registered targets 
and directs traffic only to those that pass the health checks.

Static IP Addresses: 
--------------------
Network Load Balancers provide static IP addresses that can be associated with DNS names. This makes it easier to configure DNS records and ensures consistent 
addressing for your applications.

Support for Cross-Zone Load Balancing: 
--------------------------------------
NLB distributes traffic evenly across all registered targets, regardless of the Availability Zone they belong to. This improves the availability and fault 
tolerance of your applications.

Connection Draining: 
--------------------
NLB supports connection draining, allowing in-flight requests to complete while de-registering a target. This ensures that active connections are not abruptly 
terminated.

Network Load Balancer is commonly used for scenarios that require high-performance, low-latency load balancing, such as real-time streaming, gaming applications, 
Voice over IP (VoIP), and other network-intensive workloads.
