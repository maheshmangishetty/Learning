
--> In AWS (Amazon Web Services), "target groups" refer to a component of the Elastic Load Balancing service. Elastic Load Balancing helps distribute 
incoming traffic across multiple resources, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, to improve the availability and scalability of applications.

--> A target group is a logical group of resources that receive traffic from a load balancer. It acts as a routing destination for requests and plays a 
crucial role in determining where the load balancer should send the incoming traffic. The target group defines the set of registered targets 
(such as EC2 instances) that can receive requests.

--> When you create a target group, you specify a target type, which can be an instance, IP address, or Lambda function, depending on the load balancer type. 
You can add or remove targets from the target group dynamically as your application scales up or down.

--> Target groups are associated with a load balancer and allow you to balance the traffic across multiple targets based on various criteria, such as the 
target's health, availability zone, or request type. They also support advanced features like request routing, path-based routing, and host-based routing, 
which help direct traffic to different resources based on the incoming request's characteristics.

--> In summary, target groups in AWS provide a way to organize and manage the resources that receive traffic from load balancers, enabling efficient 
distribution and scalability of applications.
