APM monitoring:

Web transaction time is the amount of time it takes for a web request to be processed and a response to be returned to the user. 
This includes all the time spent processing the request, including the time spent in the database, the application server, and the network.

Web throughput is the number of web requests that can be processed per unit of time, typically measured in requests per second (RPS). 
This metric can be used to assess the capacity of a web application to handle traffic.

Apdex score is a metric that measures the overall user satisfaction with a web application. It is calculated by taking the ratio of the number of 
satisfied requests to the total number of requests. A satisfied request is one that is completed within a certain threshold time, typically 1 second. 
A tolerated request is one that takes longer than the threshold time but is still considered acceptable by the user, typically 4 seconds. 
A frustrated request is one that takes longer than the tolerated threshold or results in an error.

Error rate is the percentage of web requests that result in errors. This metric can be used to assess the stability of a web application.

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between these metrics:
