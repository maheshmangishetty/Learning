
Synthetic monitoring in New Relic is a way to proactively test your applications and infrastructure from outside your network. 
This can help you to identify and resolve performance issues before they impact your users.

New Relic offers a variety of synthetic monitoring features, including:

HTTP checks: These checks can be used to test the availability and performance of your web applications.

Script checks: These checks can be used to test the functionality of your applications by running custom scripts.

Certificate checks: These checks can be used to verify that the SSL certificates on your websites are valid.

Synthetic browser testing: This feature allows you to simulate real user interactions with your web applications.

Synthetic monitoring can be used to monitor your applications and infrastructure from multiple locations around the world. 
This can help you to identify performance issues that may be specific to certain regions or users.

New Relic also offers a variety of features for alerting on synthetic monitoring failures. This can help you to be notified of performance issues 
as soon as they occur, so that you can take corrective action quickly.

Overall, synthetic monitoring is a valuable tool for proactively monitoring your applications and infrastructure and identifying performance issues 
before they impact your users.

Private locations in synthetic monitoring


In the context of synthetic monitoring, a private location refers to a monitoring point or agent that is set up within a private network or environment, 
typically behind a company's firewall. This private location is used to perform synthetic monitoring tests to evaluate the availability, performance, 
and functionality of web applications or services from within the organization's internal network.

Private locations are used for several purposes:

Internal Performance Monitoring: 
--------------------------------
Private locations allow organizations to assess the performance of their applications or services as experienced by internal users.
This can help identify performance issues that may be specific to the organization's network or infrastructure.

Security and Compliance: 
------------------------
Organizations can use private locations to monitor their applications or services from within their secure, private networks, ensuring that 
sensitive data and transactions are protected while still being monitored for performance and availability.

Testing for Restricted Environments: 
------------------------------------
Some applications or services may be designed to work only within specific network environments. Private locations can be set up to test these 
services in the same network conditions where they are expected to be used.

Synthetic User Experience Testing: 
----------------------------------
Private locations can simulate user interactions within an organization's network, helping to assess the user experience under various scenarios.

To set up private locations for synthetic monitoring, organizations typically install monitoring agents or nodes within their internal infrastructure. 
These agents can be configured to periodically access and interact with specific web applications or services, generating synthetic traffic that simulates 
real user interactions. The data collected from private locations is then used to analyze and optimize the performance and availability of the 
monitored applications.

It's important to note that private locations are just one part of a comprehensive synthetic monitoring strategy, which may also include public locations 
(testing from external servers or cloud providers) to gauge performance and availability from a broader perspective, encompassing external users and various 
geographical regions.
