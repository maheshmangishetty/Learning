Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) offers two general-purpose SSD (solid-state drive) volume types: gp2 and gp3. Both volume types are designed for a 
wide range of workloads, including databases, boot volumes, and development environments. 

However, there are some key differences between the two volume types.

gp2
---

Provisioned IOPS : Up to 3,000 IOPS per 1 TiB of storage
Throughput       : Up to 250 MiB/s per 1 TiB of storage
Cost             : $0.085 per GB per month


gp3
---

Provisioned IOPS : Up to 16,000 IOPS per 1 TiB of storage
Throughput       : Up to 1,000 MiB/s per 1 TiB of storage
Cost             : $0.067 per GB per month


Key differences
---------------


--->  The key difference between gp2 and gp3 is that gp3 decouples IOPS and throughput from volume size. This means that you can provision IOPS and throughput 
independently of the size of your volume. This is a significant advantage over gp2, which requires you to provision a larger volume to get higher IOPS 
and throughput.

--->  Another key difference is that gp3 offers a higher baseline performance than gp2. gp3 volumes provide a baseline of 3,000 IOPS and 125 MiB/s of throughput, 
regardless of the volume size. This means that you can get good performance even with small volumes.

--->  Finally, gp3 is up to 20% cheaper than gp2. This is because you can provision smaller volumes with gp3 and get the same performance as gp2.



Use cases
---------

---> gp2 and gp3 are both good choices for a wide range of workloads. However, gp3 is a better choice for workloads that require high IOPS and throughput, 
such as databases and boot volumes. gp2 is a good choice for workloads that require lower IOPS and throughput, such as development environments and file storage.

---> I recommend that you use gp3 for all new workloads unless you have a specific reason to use gp2. gp3 offers better performance and lower costs than gp2. 
If you are currently using gp2 volumes, you can migrate them to gp3 without any downtime.


Here is a table summarizing the key differences between gp2 and gp3:
